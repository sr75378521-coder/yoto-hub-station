## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Server Functions

All data fetching is implemented as secure server functions with Supabase authentication:

```typescript
// Family data
getFamilyData(): Promise<FamilyData>
  - Fetches from: /family/users
  - Returns: { connected, members, errorMessage? }

// Playlist data
getPlaylistsData(): Promise<PlaylistData>
  - Fetches from: /playlist-v2/playlists
  - Returns: { connected, playlists, errorMessage? }

getPlaylistDetails(playlistId): Promise<any>
  - Fetches from: /playlist-v2/playlists/{playlistId}
  - Returns: Detailed playlist information

// Settings data
getSettingsData(): Promise<SettingsData>
  - Sources: Supabase Auth + Yoto Account
  - Returns: { connected, settings, errorMessage? }
```

### Type Definitions

Full TypeScript interfaces for type safety:

```typescript
interface FamilyMember {
  userId: string;
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  email?: string;
  profileImage?: string;
  role?: string;
}

interface PlaylistSummary {
  playlistId: string;
  name: string;
  type?: string;
  artwork?: string;
  duration?: number;
  trackCount?: number;
  createdDate?: string;
  isEditable?: boolean;
}

interface UserSettings {
  theme?: string;
  notifications?: boolean;
  apiStatus?: string;
  accountEmail?: string;
  accountName?: string;
}
```

### Data Caching Strategy

- **Players**: 30-second refresh (real-time data)
- **Family**: 60-second refresh (less frequently changing)
- **Playlists**: 60-second refresh (less frequently changing)
- Manual refresh buttons on all pages
- TanStack Query handles cache invalidation
